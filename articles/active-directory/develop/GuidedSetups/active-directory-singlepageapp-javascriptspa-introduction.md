### More Information

The sample application created by this guide enables a JavaScript SPA to query the Microsoft Graph API or a Web API that accepts tokens from Azure Active Directory v2 endpoint. For this scenario, after a user signs-in, a token is added to HTTP requests via the authorization header. Token acquisition and renewal is handled by the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL).
